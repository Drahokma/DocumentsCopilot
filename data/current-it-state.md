# MediaVision Global - Current IT State Assessment

## Infrastructure Overview
- **On-premises Infrastructure:**
  - 5 physical servers (average age: 4.5 years)
  - 3 storage arrays with 120TB total capacity (78% utilized)
  - Local backup system with tape rotation (weekly full, daily incremental)
  
- **Cloud Infrastructure:**
  - AWS environment for web properties and content delivery
  - Approximately 40% of workloads currently in cloud
  - No hybrid cloud management strategy
  
- **Network Infrastructure:**
  - 1Gbps internet connection with basic redundancy
  - Outdated network switches (majority 1Gbps)
  - Basic firewall and perimeter security
  - VPN for remote access with limited capacity

## Software and Applications
- **Content Production:**
  - Adobe Creative Cloud for content creation
  - DaVinci Resolve for video editing and color grading
  - Multiple disconnected digital asset management systems
  
- **Business Applications:**
  - Custom-built content management system (5 years old)
  - Salesforce for client management
  - QuickBooks Enterprise for accounting
  - Disparate project management tools (Asana, Trello, Monday.com) across departments
  
- **Collaboration Tools:**
  - Microsoft 365 E3 licenses for all staff
  - Zoom for video conferencing
  - Slack for internal communications

## Security and Compliance
- **Current Security Measures:**
  - Basic endpoint protection on workstations
  - No centralized security information and event management (SIEM)
  - Irregular security audits (last performed 18 months ago)
  - Limited data loss prevention controls
  
- **Compliance Status:**
  - Not fully compliant with industry content security standards
  - Inadequate access control mechanisms
  - Limited encryption for data at rest
  - No formal security awareness training program

## Data Management
- **Storage Systems:**
  - Multiple disconnected storage systems
  - No content lifecycle management
  - Manual archiving processes
  - Limited metadata tagging and search capabilities
  
- **Backup and Disaster Recovery:**
  - Basic backup system with no regular testing
  - Recovery time objective (RTO) currently at 48+ hours
  - No formal business continuity plan
  - Limited off-site backup storage

## Key Pain Points
1. **Storage and Workflow Bottlenecks:**
   - Content transfer speeds causing production delays
   - Insufficient storage for growing 4K content creation
   - File versioning and collaboration challenges
   
2. **Technical Debt:**
   - Aging hardware requiring frequent maintenance
   - Custom CMS with limited support and development resources
   - Disparate systems requiring manual data transfer
   
3. **Security Vulnerabilities:**
   - Insufficient protection for valuable intellectual property
   - Limited visibility into potential security threats
   - Inconsistent access control across systems
   
4. **Operational Inefficiencies:**
   - IT team (5 staff) spending 70% of time on maintenance vs. innovation
   - Significant downtime during system updates
   - Limited automation for routine tasks
   - Poor integration between business systems

## Recent Incidents
1. Storage system failure in July 2024 resulted in 36 hours of production downtime
2. Minor security breach in March 2024 exposed non-sensitive customer data
3. Cloud costs exceeded budget by 35% in Q2 2024 due to poor resource optimization
4. Content delivery delays to three major clients in 2024 due to technical issues

## Current Support Structure
- Internal IT team of 5 (1 IT Manager, 2 System Administrators, 2 Support Specialists)
- Ad-hoc external support for specialized systems
- No 24/7 monitoring or support coverage
- Average ticket resolution time: 27 hours
